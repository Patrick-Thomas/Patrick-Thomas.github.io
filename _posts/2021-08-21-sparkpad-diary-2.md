## Development

### Case
We've expanded the range of colour options for the Sparkpad case, in response to positive feedback on a custom pink Sparkpad we recently prepared for [Artesian Builds](https://artesianbuilds.com/){:target="_blank"}.

The extra colour options are now available through our online shop. 

### Firmware
A few new features have been added to Sparkpad's lighting controls:

* Active and inactive colours 
* Default startup colours
* Group toggle function

See our [setup guide](https://sparkpad.co.uk/sparkpad-setup-guide/){:target="_blank"} to learn more about these features and how to get the latest firmware onto your Sparkpad.

## Online
