# Introduction
A very good friend of mine has recently become an affiliate streamer on Twitch ([Gameswithjames01](https://www.twitch.tv/gameswithjames01){:target="_blank"}). With more and more people turning their love of gaming into a side-gig, the demand for streaming gear is increasing, and this creates opportunities for those looking to innovate in the market.

For an affiliate streamer, one of their main aims is keeping viewers engaged with the content. A stream is not a simple matter of playing a game, it also involves: responding to messages, mixing audio levels, handling transitions, and more. Juggling these tasks effectively creates a seamless viewer experience, which in turn keeps them engaged.
